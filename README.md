##Project Description
The core of PHY 471 is an advanced laboratory project, and the topic of this experimental study is study and performance of numerical studies on magnetic systems. To do this, the student utilized the C programming language together with numerical programming techniques. These techniques included utilizing the Monte Carlo method and finding numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations. Ultimately, the student applied these methods and the fields of statistical mechanics, magnetism, and solid state physics to a theoretical model consisting of a system of interacting magnetic spins characterized by the Heisenberg Model. The lab work was performed in the department's High Resolution Imaging and Computation Center Facility. The final product is a written project report and a formal presentation to the department.

##Project Sponsor
Dr. Enjalran, who has research experience in the topic of the project and who designed and assembled the laboratory, guided and supervised all aspects of the laboratory work and analysis, and provided the necessary feedback to facilitate effective revision of the project report (including feedback on paper drafts). All physics full-time faculty attended the final presentation and commented on the student's performance including content mastery and clarity of presentation.
